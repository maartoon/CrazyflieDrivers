#       Description: This file contains the template for the trajectory planner.
#                    Students will implement the logic to generate a dynamically
#                    feasible, time-optimal trajectory through a series of
#                    waypoints (gates). The planner should respect the drone's
#                    physical constraints on velocity and acceleration.
